# IndividualProject2

This is my first Individual Project.  
So, we can start by creating new environment.  
```
python3 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate.bat
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Background Idea Of This Project
We are creating a simple calculator for our first mini project to learn basic programming concepts such as functions, control flow, and error handling. This project provides immediate feedback, making the learning process more engaging and practical. By defining the requirements for basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division), planning the structure with a class and corresponding methods, implementing the code for these operations and user input handling, and thoroughly testing the application, we aim to build a useful tool that solidifies core programming skills and serves as a foundation for more complex projects.  

# Question 1

Draw a flowchart to write the program of this task. You may draw a flowchart by using powerpoint, then save it as a picture in .jpg or .png.  
Answer:

# Question 2

How would you like to improve your calculator codes?  
Answer:  
I would like to improve my calculator code by adding more advanced mathematical operations and improve error handling to managed invalid inputs by users.
